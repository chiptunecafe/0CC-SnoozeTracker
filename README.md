# CC-SnoozeTracker
SN76489 tracker made with Unity. Supports custom waveforms and samples (even on noise PSG!).

Requires tiny file dialogs in Plugins folder for appropriate architecture/OS (https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/)

Requires Ionic.ZLib in Plugins folder. (http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com/)

Requires MIDI.Net in Plugins folder. (https://github.com/jstnryan/midi-dot-net/)

Updated by Blue Mario. Since the old main tracker is no longer in development, this fork was made to keep it up to date with fixed bugs and new features. Currently, there are no changes yet, however a new version will likely be released, soon.
